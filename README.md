Forecasting Future Temperatures Using Deep Learning

I built and trained a Long-Term-Short Memory (LSTM) network model using historical global temperatures to forecast future temperatures. This is important for future resource planning. The next steps in this project is to set up a dashboard using the Python Dash package and connect to a weather API to run the data through the model.
